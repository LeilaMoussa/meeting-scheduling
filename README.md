# meeting-scheduling
Disclaimer: very much a work in progress! A lot remains to be implemented and tested!

Read from specific PDFs generated by AUI-Jenzabar's Learning Management System to schedule meeting times for many AUI people.

Almost the same basic scheduling problem was used in Cl√©ment Mihailescu's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q_oYDQ2whs&t=1257s

Valid input guaranteed -- no edge cases handled.

To-dos:
- [ ] Implement text parser
- [ ] Account for minimum meeting duration
- [ ] Thorough testing

Room for improvement:
- [ ] Simplify the implementation (use less terrible data structures)
- [ ] Account for time & space efficiency
- [ ] Ability to add an acceptable meeting time to the user's Outlook Calendar (using Outlook API)

Any help/suggestion is appreciated.
